#parts of the project, instructions/hints/examples, and at the end, TESTS.

## Import statements
import unittest
import requests
import re
from bs4 import BeautifulSoup


## Part 1 -- Define your find_urls function here.
## INPUT: any string
## RETURN VALUE: a list of strings that represents all of the URLs in the input string


## For example:
## find_urls("http://www.google.com is a great site") should return ["http://www.google.com"]
## find_urls("I love looking at websites like http://etsy.com and http://instagram.com and stuff") should return ["http://etsy.com","http://instagram.com"]
## find_urls("the internet is awesome #worldwideweb") should return [], empty list

def find_urls(s):
    return re.findall('(http[s]?:\/\/[\S]+\.\S+)', s)
    # url = s
    # urllst = re.findall('^h.+m', url)
    # print (urllst)
    # return urllst

## PART 2  - Define a function grab_headlines.
## INPUT: N/A. No input.
## Grab the headlines from the "Most Read" section of
## http://www.michigandaily.com/section/opinion

def grab_headlines():
    pass
    #Your code here



## PART 3 (a) Define a function called get_umsi_data.  It should create a dictionary
## saved in a variable umsi_titles whose keys are UMSI people's names, and whose
## associated values are those people's titles, e.g. "PhD student" or "Associate
## Professor of Information"...
## Start with this page: https://www.si.umich.edu/directory?field_person_firstname_value=&field_person_lastname_value=&rid=All
## End with this page: https://www.si.umich.edu/directory?field_person_firstname_value=&field_person_lastname_value=&rid=All&page=12
## INPUT: N/A. No input.
## OUTPUT: Return umsi_titles
## Reminder: you'll need to use the special header for a request to the UMSI site, like so:
## requests.get(base_url, headers={'User-Agent': 'SI_CLASS'})

def get_umsi_data():
    pass
    #Your code here

## PART 3 (b) Define a function called num_students.
## INPUT: The dictionary from get_umsi_data().
## OUTPUT: Return number of PhD students in the data.  (Don't forget, I may change the input data)
def num_students(data):
    pass
    #Your code here
